            <h4>Bacon Cheeseburger with Veggies</h4>

            <p>In order to make a burger you include the 
                meat, bread, lettuce, and bacon. Hopefully,
                this fills out a tiny paragraph at least just
                so I can see whether or not I am writing the 
                code properly. This is still all very new and 
                writing on VSCode is like writing on a typewriter
                since I have to hit enter to make sure my line 
                doesn't go too far off the side. </p>

            <p>Time to break out the lorem ipsulum. Just kidding
                it ends up going too damn far and makes the lines
                reach all the way over to Japan. Hopefully soon I'll
                be able to fix this problem going forward because
                its not fun at all having to stop myself from
                getting too into the writing and then breaking my
                train of thought. That's enough of a paragaph I reckon. </p>
