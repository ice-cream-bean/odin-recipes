        <h4>Sliced Cucumber Roll</h4>
        <p>This <strong>beautiful</strong> piece of American ingenuity lends itself perfectly to
           those who believe fish is overrated. Turning a blind eye to the rich and wonderful Japanese 
           tradition of <em>fish</em> and rice wrapped with seaweed, the Cucumber Roll has burst onto 
           the scene to fill the void in a vegetarian's soul.</p>
        <p>Why add a delectable piece of bluefin tuna or a fabously grilled and sauced piece of eel
           when you could chop up a cucumber as a substitute? Should you ever get a hankering for rice
           and vegetables, the Cucumber Roll has got you covered! Today you'll learn the arduous process
