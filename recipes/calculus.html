        <h1>What Went Through Newton's Noggin (besides an apple)</h1>

        <h3>Why would Ol' Newty Create Calculus?</h3>
        <p>Our good ol' pal, Isaac Newton, got tired after a heat wave one day and decided to rest under
           an apple tree. That tree would then proceed to launch an apple with as much force as its branches
           could muster at Isaac's head in an attempt to kill him. Luckily, that tree forgot that it wasn't 
           a coconut tree and, unless it was home to a wasp's nest, didn't have a way that to
           commit first degree murder. Newton was unperturbed by the attempt on his life and decided to 
           create an entire new type of math to ensure that millions of trees would be cut down for the rest
           of history in order to make textbooks.
